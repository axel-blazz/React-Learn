<!-- React Flow and Structure -->
Js is normally injected in HTML with script tag
React normally makes single page applications (ek hi div me sab kuchh inject hota hai)
Raect makes apna DOM tree (Virtual DoM) different from the browser Dom tree -> compares with main dom and makes approoprate changes in main dom

When you make a component, make ure to name it jsx, uppercase first letter

Each function is bundled and parsed into a browser readable format by Babel(used here)
